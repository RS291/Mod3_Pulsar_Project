# Predicting Pulsars
## Module 3 Machine Learning Project

### Business Problem: <br/>
I conducted an exploratory data analysis and created models to accurately predict whether or not a candidate star is a pulsar or a false positive.  <br/>

For this project, I assumed the role of a Data Scientist working with an astronomical research agency to train a machine learning model to classify whether a star is a pulsar or not.
A pulsar is a rotating, magnetized Neutron star that emits radiation(mostly radio, X-ray, and gamma wavelength) from its poles. Other than black holes, pulsars are the most dense objects in the known universe. Pulsars rotate with a very short and precise period which vary from star to star, however due to Radio Frequency Interference and background radiation noise, there are many false-positives when attempting to detect pulsars. <br>

As stated above, the overall goal is to train the most accurate classification model possible, without the concern of computational cost or time. 

### Methods: 
I used the OSEMN data science process(Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret).  

I used Python 3 and the following libraries to process and model the data: NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, itertools, statsmodels, scipy, xgboost, sklearn, and imblearn.
